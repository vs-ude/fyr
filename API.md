# Fyr Compiler API Docs

This is the API documentation for the [Fyr](http://fyr.vs.uni-due.de/) compiler.  
It is aimed to help development of the language, not applications written in it.
If you require information about the language itself, head over to the main page.

## Parser

Parsing is done with [PEG.js](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs).
The definitions are not included in this documentation but can be found in _compiler/parser.pegjs_.

## Repository

You can find the source of the compiler on [GitHub](https://github.com/weistn).
